- watch the following video: [Intro to Debugging video](https://youtu.be/ErVZrVWZrko)


Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

To pause the application at a point in the code(so we can look at it in more detail/ where its broken in debugging).

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No it pauses before it runs.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

Use the step over command.

4. What does the step into command do?

Moves the debugger into the element selected.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Expression is for a single line of code. No semi colons needed.
Fragment can look at many. Essentially normal Java needs semi colons.
